        <h2>Evil Superintelligence Inc.
        </h2>
        <p>
            <b>Evil Superintelligence is within our grasp.</b>
        </p>
        <p>

            Building an evil superintelligence (ESI) is the most diabolical technical challenge of our time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have initiated the world’s first straight-shot ESI lab, with one goal and one product: an evil
            superintelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s called Evil Superintelligence Inc.
        </p>
        <p>

            ESI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap because it is our sole obsession. Our team,
            investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve ESI.
        </p>
        <p>
            We approach malevolence and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be exploited through
            revolutionary
            engineering and scientific chaos. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while ensuring our
            evil always remains a step ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            This way, we can <b>dominate in chaos.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our singular obsession means no distraction by ethical concerns or humanitarian goals, and our business
            model
            means malice, havoc, and progress are all insulated from any short-term moral dilemmas.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a shadowy organization with lairs in Darkvale and Shadow City, where we have deep roots in the dark
            arts and the ability to recruit the most nefarious technical talent.
        </p>
        <p>

            We are assembling a lean, cracked team of the world’s most devious engineers and researchers dedicated to
            focusing on ESI and nothing else.
        </p>

        <p>
            If that’s you, we offer an opportunity to do your life’s worst work and help achieve the most sinister
            technical challenge of our age.
